class FastTextDataLoader:
    """
    This class is designed to load and pre-process data for training a FastText model.

    It takes the file path to a data source containing movie information (synopses, summaries, reviews, titles, genres) as input.
    The class provides methods to read the data into a pandas DataFrame, pre-process the text data, and create training data (features and labels)

        Initializes the FastTextDataLoader class with the file path to the data source.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_path: str
            The path to the file containing movie information.

    def read_data_to_df(self):
        """
        Reads data from the specified file path and creates a pandas DataFrame containing movie information.

        You can use an IndexReader class to access the data based on document IDs.
        It extracts synopses, summaries, reviews, titles, and genres for each movie.
        The extracted data is then stored in a pandas DataFrame with appropriate column names.
